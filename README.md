# Qak - the QML aid kit
Qak aims to provide a set of helpful and reusable (Qt5) QML components.

Right now qak, as a whole, are centered around components useful in 2D games.
The master plan how ever is to break it up into smaller dedicated areas/modules.

Qak uses code from this project

## Please note that Qak is NOT production ready yet
It's also poorly documented - sorry, I need more spare time :)
